Parser Algorithm
================

TODO(josh): add notes regarding the standard parse function and what it does
with regard to positionals and kwargs. Then add notes about the new style
parser which uses nested function calls. Note that the motivation for this is
commands that take multiple forms. We need computational logic to look at the
first argument to determine how to parse the rest of it.
