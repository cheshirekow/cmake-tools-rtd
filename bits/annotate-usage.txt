usage: 
cmake-annotate [-h]
             [--format {page,stub}]
             [-o OUTFILE_PATH]
             [-c CONFIG_FILE]
             infilepath [infilepath ...]

Parse cmake listfiles and re-emit them with semantic annotations in HTML.

Some options regarding parsing are configurable by providing a configuration
file. The configuration file format is the same as that used by cmake-format,
and the same file can be used for both programs.

cmake-format can spit out the default configuration for you as starting point
for customization. Run with `--dump-config [yaml|json|python]`.

positional arguments:
  infilepaths

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  -o OUTFILE_PATH, --outfile-path OUTFILE_PATH
                        Where to write the formatted file. Default is stdout.
